PopED computes optimal experimental designs for both population and
individual studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models. Often this is
based on a computation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).

## Installation

You need to have R installed. Download the latest version of R from
www.r-project.org. You can install the released version of PopED from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PopED")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrewhooker/PopED")
```

## Getting started

To get started you need to define

1.  A model.
2.  An initial design (and design space if you want to optimize).
3.  The tasks to perform.
