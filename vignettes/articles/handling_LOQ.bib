	Abstract = {Several developments have facilitated the practical application and increased the general use of optimal design for nonlinear mixed effects models. These developments include new methodology for utilizing advanced pharmacometric models, faster optimization algorithms and user friendly software tools. In this paper we present the extension of the optimal design software PopED, which incorporates many of these recent advances into an easily useable enhanced GUI. Furthermore, we present new solutions to problems related to the design of experiments such as: faster and more robust FIM calculations and optimizations, optimizing over cost/utility functions and diagnostic tools and plots to evaluate design performance. Examples for; (i) Group size optimization and efficiency translation, (ii) Cost/constraint optimization, (iii) Optimizations with different FIM approximations and (iv) optimization with parallel computing demonstrate the new features in PopED and underline the potential use of this tool when designing experiments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{nyberg2015,
	Abstract = {Population Pharmacokinetic (PK)-Pharmacodynamic (PD) (PKPD) models are increasingly used in drug development and in academic research. Hence designing efficient studies is an important task. Following the first theoretical work on optimal design for nonlinear mixed effect models, this research theme has grown rapidly. There are now several different software tools that implement an evaluation of the Fisher information matrix for population PKPD. We compared and evaluated five software tools: PFIM, PkStaMP, PopDes, PopED, and POPT. The comparisons were performed using two models: i) a simple one compartment warfarin PK model; ii) a more complex PKPD model for Pegylated-interferon (peg-interferon) with both concentration and response of viral load of hepatitis C virus (HCV) data. The results of the software were compared in terms of the standard error values of the parameters (SE) predicted from the software and the empirical SE values obtained via replicated clinical trial simulation and estimation. For the warfarin PK model and the peg-interferon PKPD model all software gave similar results. Of interest it was seen, for all software, that the simpler approximation to the Fisher information matrix, using the block diagonal matrix, provided predicted SE values that were closer to the empirical SE values than when the more complicated approximation was used (the full matrix). For most PKPD models, using any of the available software tools will provide meaningful results, avoiding cumbersome simulation and allowing design optimisation.},

	Abstract = {Methods that perform well in handling limit of quantification (LOQ) data exist in estimation of parameters for non-linear mixed effect models but are not well developed in experimental design.  The aim of this work was to evaluate existing methods and to explore new methods of handling LOQs in Optimal Design (OD). Seven different methods were implemented in PopED 2.13: D1 (Ignore LOQ), D2 (Non-informative Fisher information matrix (FIM) for median response below LOQ), new D3 (Non-informative FOCE linearized FIM for individual response below LOQ), D4 (Addition of a homoscedastic variance), new D5 (Simulation &amp; Rescaling), new D6 (Integration &amp; Rescaling) and new D7 (joint likelihood using the Laplace approximation). Predictive performance of D1-D7 was first assessed and sample time optimization was performed for a number of different LOQ levels. Resulting designs were evaluated for bias and imprecision, robustness and predictability from multiple stochastic simulations and estimations (SSE) in NONMEM using the M3 method. Evaluated determinants of the FIM for all methods, except D1 and D4, were in good agreement with SSE-derived covariance. In optimization, D6 provided the most accurate and precise parameter estimates and the designs with the best predictive performance under the M3 method. Methods D1 and D2 resulted in the least robust designs for estimation. Method D4 was shown to be insensitive to LOQ levels. For the scenarios investigated, method D6 showed the best compromise in terms of speed and accuracy. The use of OD methods anticipating LOQ data in planned designs allows better parameter estimation. },
