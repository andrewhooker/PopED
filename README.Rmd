PopED computes optimal experimental designs for both population 
and individual studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models. 
Often this is based on a computation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). 

## Installation

You need to have R installed.  Download the latest version of R from www.r-project.org.
You can install the released version of PopED from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PopED")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrewhooker/PopED")
```
## Getting started

To get started you need to define 

1. A model.
2. An initial design (and design space if you want to optimize). 
3. The tasks to perform.
