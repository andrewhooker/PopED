Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Foracchia (24:50)
  Nyberg (23:62)
  al (23:72, 24:63)
  et (23:69, 24:60)
     
The first portion is just stating that I am the maintainer.  

The second portion does not recognize the last names of the first authors
of the papers that describe the methods we implement in the package as well as "et al.". 
   
## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of PopED 
(https://github.com/andrewhooker/PopED/tree/master/revdep). 
All packages passed.
